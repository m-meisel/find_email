# README

## Stack
* Ruby on Rails 6.1

* React

## Run
* Add the Apilayer API-Key with the key: `apilayer`
* Start the rails server using `rails s`

## Missing due to time constraints
* RSpec tests
* React / Javascript tests

## Additional notes
* When we do the API call to check for existing emails we do not check the catch_all flag as it's not supported using the free subscription
